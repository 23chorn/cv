# Christopher Horn – CV Repository

This repository contains multiple versions of my CV, tailored for different audiences and roles.  
All CVs are written in Markdown and can be viewed directly on GitHub or exported to PDF.  

## Available Versions
- [General CV](cv/cv-general.md) – broad overview of product management and technical experience.  
- [Startup CV](cv/cv-startup.md) – emphasizes full-stack projects, rapid prototyping, and technical depth.  
- [Corporate CV](cv/cv-corporate.md) – focuses on large-scale roadmap delivery, stakeholder management, and enterprise impact.  
- [Data CV](cv/cv-data.md) – highlights analytics, Python/SQL skills, and data-driven product decisions.  

## Notes
- Each version is regularly updated to ensure consistency.  
- The **General CV** is the best starting point for most audiences.  
- PDFs can be generated from the markdown using tools like [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).
