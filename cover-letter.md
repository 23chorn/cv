<p class="cover-dear">Dear Prisma Team,</p>

I’m excited to apply for the Senior Product Manager role. I bring product leadership experience along with hands-on skills in Python, SQL, React, and cloud tooling. I love diving into technical details—prototyping full-stack projects, building automation, dashboards, and APIs—to create solutions that are both usable and scalable.

Prisma’s work on advanced database tooling and modern developer workflows is particularly compelling. I’m excited by the challenge of shaping features like Prisma Postgres® and Studio, optimizing performance, and improving how developers interact with data at scale.

I’m passionate about building developer-focused tools that make a real difference. I’m eager to learn new technologies, collaborate closely with engineers, and take ownership of product decisions that deliver impact. The opportunity to help shape Prisma’s developer-first platform and push the boundaries of database tooling genuinely excites me.

Thank you for considering my application; I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team.

**Best regards,**  
Christopher Horn
